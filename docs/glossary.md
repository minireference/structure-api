Established concepts:

  - Node
    - subject: a macros subject like mathematics, physics, or cryptography
    - topic: a particular area of study or specific topic within a subject
    - concept: a particular building idea or building block

  - Relation
    - prerequisite/usedfor: you need to know X to learn Y
    - ispartof/contains: generic topic-subtopic stucture
    - related: the concepts X you're learning are related to the concept Y


Potential concepts:

  - level: to describe the educational level at which this link/relation is revealed
    e.g., when level = HS we use a simplified concept map with focus on math nodes
    that are most relevant for high school students, when level = UGRAD we use a
    more complex graph but still hide some more advances topics to avoid being
    overwhelming, and finally level = GRAD shows all concepts and links.
