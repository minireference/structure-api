  comment: Modeling is best interpreted not as a collection of isolated topics but
    in relation to other standards. Making mathematical models is a Standard for Mathematical
    Practice, and specific modeling standards appear throughout the high school standards
    indicated by a star symbol (★). The star symbol sometimes appears on the heading
    for a group of standards; in that case, it should be understood to apply to all
    standards in that group.
