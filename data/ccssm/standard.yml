    These Standards define what students should understand and be able to do in their
    study of mathematics. Asking a student to understand something means asking a
    teacher to assess whether the student has understood it. But what does mathematical
    understanding look like? One hallmark of mathematical understanding is the ability
    to justify, in a way appropriate to the student's mathematical maturity, why a
    particular mathematical statement is true or where a mathematical rule comes from.
    There is a world of difference between a student who can summon a mnemonic device
    to expand a product such as (a + b)(x + y) and a student who can explain where
    the mnemonic comes from. The student who can explain the rule understands the
    mathematics, and may have a better chance to succeed at a less familiar task such
    as expanding (a + b + c)(x + y). Mathematical understanding and procedural skill
    are equally important, and both are assessable using mathematical tasks of sufficient
    richness.
