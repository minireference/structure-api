  comment: For example, collect data from a random sample of students in your school
    on their favorite subject among math, science, and English. Estimate the probability
    that a randomly selected student from your school will favor science given that
    the student is in tenth grade. Do the same for other subjects and compare the

  comment: For example, find a current data distribution on the number of TV sets
    per household in the United States, and calculate the expected number of sets
    per household. How many TV sets would you expect to find in 100 randomly selected
    households?

    High School — Statistics and Probability
  comment: Modeling is best interpreted not as a collection of isolated topics but
    in relation to other standards. Making mathematical models is a Standard for Mathematical
    Practice, and specific modeling standards appear throughout the high school standards
    indicated by a star symbol (★). The star symbol sometimes appears on the heading
    for a group of standards; in that case, it should be understood to apply to all
    standards in that group.
