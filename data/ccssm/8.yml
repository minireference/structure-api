    Use rational approximations of irrational numbers to compare the size of irrational
    numbers, locate them approximately on a number line diagram, and estimate the
    value of expressions (e.g., π²).
  comment: For example, by truncating the decimal expansion of √2, show that √2 is
    between 1 and 2, then between 1.4 and 1.5, and explain how to continue on to get
    better approximations.

    Know that straight lines are widely used to model relationships between two quantitative
    variables. For scatter plots that suggest a linear association, informally fit
    a straight line, and informally assess the model fit by judging the closeness
    of the data points to the line.

    Use the equation of a linear model to solve problems in the context of bivariate
    measurement data, interpreting the slope and intercept.
  comment: For example, in a linear model for a biology experiment, interpret a slope
    of 1.5 cm/hr as meaning that an additional hour of sunlight each day is associated
    with an additional 1.5 cm in mature plant height.

    Understand that patterns of association can also be seen in bivariate categorical
    data by displaying frequencies and relative frequencies in a two-way table. Construct
    and interpret a two-way table summarizing data on two categorical variables collected
    from the same subjects. Use relative frequencies calculated for rows or columns
    to describe possible association between the two variables.
  comment: For example, collect data from students in your class on whether or not
    they have a curfew on school nights and whether or not they have assigned chores
    at home. Is there evidence that those who have a curfew also tend to have chores?
