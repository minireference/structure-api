    Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
  comment: Mathematically proficient students start by explaining to themselves the
    meaning of a problem and looking for entry points to its solution. They analyze
    givens, constraints, relationships, and goals. They make conjectures about the
    form and meaning of the solution and plan a solution pathway rather than simply
    jumping into a solution attempt. They consider analogous problems, and try special
    cases and simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into
    its solution. They monitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessary.
    Older students might, depending on the context of the problem, transform algebraic
    expressions or change the viewing window on their graphing calculator to get the
    information they need. Mathematically proficient students can explain correspondences
    between equations, verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs or draw diagrams of
    important features and relationships, graph data, and search for regularity or
    trends. Younger students might rely on using concrete objects or pictures to help
    conceptualize and solve a problem. Mathematically proficient students check their
    answers to problems using a different method, and they continually ask themselves,
    "Does this make sense?" They can understand the approaches of others to solving
    complex problems and identify correspondences between different approaches.

    Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
  comment: 'Mathematically proficient students make sense of quantities and their
    relationships in problem situations. They bring two complementary abilities to
    bear on problems involving quantitative relationships: the ability to decontextualize—to
    abstract a given situation and represent it symbolically and manipulate the representing
    symbols as if they have a life of their own, without necessarily attending to
    their referents—and the ability to contextualize, to pause as needed during the
    manipulation process in order to probe into the referents for the symbols involved.
    Quantitative reasoning entails habits of creating a coherent representation of
    the problem at hand; considering the units involved; attending to the meaning
    of quantities, not just how to compute them; and knowing and flexibly using different
    properties of operations and objects.'

    Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.
  comment: Mathematically proficient students understand and use stated assumptions,
    definitions, and previously established results in constructing arguments. They
    make conjectures and build a logical progression of statements to explore the
    truth of their conjectures. They are able to analyze situations by breaking them
    into cases, and can recognize and use counterexamples. They justify their conclusions,
    communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others. They reason
    inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the
    context from which the data arose. Mathematically proficient students are also
    able to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct
    logic or reasoning from that which is flawed, and—if there is a flaw in an argument—explain
    what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents
    such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense
    and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later
    grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies.
    Students at all grades can listen or read the arguments of others, decide whether
    they make sense, and ask useful questions to clarify or improve the arguments.

    Model with mathematics.
  comment: Mathematically proficient students can apply the mathematics they know
    to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace. In early
    grades, this might be as simple as writing an addition equation to describe a
    situation. In middle grades, a student might apply proportional reasoning to plan
    a school event or analyze a problem in the community. By high school, a student
    might use geometry to solve a design problem or use a function to describe how
    one quantity of interest depends on another. Mathematically proficient students
    who can apply what they know are comfortable making assumptions and approximations
    to simplify a complicated situation, realizing that these may need revision later.
    They are able to identify important quantities in a practical situation and map
    their relationships using such tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts
    and formulas. They can analyze those relationships mathematically to draw conclusions.
    They routinely interpret their mathematical results in the context of the situation
    and reflect on whether the results make sense, possibly improving the model if
    it has not served its purpose.

    Use appropriate tools strategically.
  comment: Mathematically proficient students consider the available tools when solving
    a mathematical problem. These tools might include pencil and paper, concrete models,
    a ruler, a protractor, a calculator, a spreadsheet, a computer algebra system,
    a statistical package, or dynamic geometry software. Proficient students are sufficiently
    familiar with tools appropriate for their grade or course to make sound decisions
    about when each of these tools might be helpful, recognizing both the insight
    to be gained and their limitations. For example, mathematically proficient high
    school students analyze graphs of functions and solutions generated using a graphing
    calculator. They detect possible errors by strategically using estimation and
    other mathematical knowledge. When making mathematical models, they know that
    technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore
    consequences, and compare predictions with data. Mathematically proficient students
    at various grade levels are able to identify relevant external mathematical resources,
    such as digital content located on a website, and use them to pose or solve problems.
    They are able to use technological tools to explore and deepen their understanding
    of concepts.

    Attend to precision.
  comment: Mathematically proficient students try to communicate precisely to others.
    They try to use clear definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning.
    They state the meaning of the symbols they choose, including using the equal sign
    consistently and appropriately. They are careful about specifying units of measure,
    and labeling axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a problem.
    They calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers with a degree
    of precision appropriate for the problem context. In the elementary grades, students
    give carefully formulated explanations to each other. By the time they reach high
    school they have learned to examine claims and make explicit use of definitions.

    Look for and make use of structure.
  comment: Mathematically proficient students look closely to discern a pattern or
    structure. Young students, for example, might notice that three and seven more
    is the same amount as seven and three more, or they may sort a collection of shapes
    according to how many sides the shapes have. Later, students will see 7 × 8 equals
    the well remembered 7 × 5 + 7 × 3, in preparation for learning about the distributive
    property. In the expression x² + 9x + 14, older students can see the 14 as 2 ×
    7 and the 9 as 2 + 7. They recognize the significance of an existing line in a
    geometric figure and can use the strategy of drawing an auxiliary line for solving
    problems. They also can step back for an overview and shift perspective. They
    can see complicated things, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects
    or as being composed of several objects. For example, they can see 5 – 3(x – y)²
    as 5 minus a positive number times a square and use that to realize that its value
    cannot be more than 5 for any real numbers x and y.

    Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.
  comment: Mathematically proficient students notice if calculations are repeated,
    and look both for general methods and for shortcuts. Upper elementary students
    might notice when dividing 25 by 11 that they are repeating the same calculations
    over and over again, and conclude they have a repeating decimal. By paying attention
    to the calculation of slope as they repeatedly check whether points are on the
    line through (1, 2) with slope 3, middle school students might abstract the equation
    (y – 2)/(x – 1) = 3. Noticing the regularity in the way terms cancel when expanding
    (x – 1)(x + 1), (x – 1)(x² + x + 1), and (x – 1)(x³ + x² + x + 1) might lead them
    to the general formula for the sum of a geometric series. As they work to solve
    a problem, mathematically proficient students maintain oversight of the process,
    while attending to the details. They continually evaluate the reasonableness of
    their intermediate results.
