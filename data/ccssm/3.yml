    Understand that shapes in different categories (e.g., rhombuses, rectangles, and
    others) may share attributes (e.g., having four sides), and that the shared attributes
    can define a larger category (e.g., quadrilaterals). Recognize rhombuses, rectangles,
    and squares as examples of quadrilaterals, and draw examples of quadrilaterals
    that do not belong to any of these subcategories.

    Apply properties of operations as strategies to multiply and divide.
  comment: 'Students need not use formal terms for these properties.

    Example: Knowing that 8 × 5 = 40 and 8 × 2 = 16, one can find 8 × 7 as 8 × (5
    + 2) = (8 × 5) + (8 × 2) = 40 + 16 = 56. (Distributive property.)

    Example: If 6 × 4 = 24 is known, then 4 × 6 = 24 is also known (Commutative property
    of multiplication.) 3 × 5 × 2 can be found by 3 × 5 = 15, then 15 × 2 = 30, or
    by 5 × 2 = 10, then 3 × 10 = 30. (Associative property of multiplication.)'
