    Use a pair of perpendicular number lines, called axes, to define a coordinate
    system, with the intersection of the lines (the origin) arranged to coincide with
    the 0 on each line and a given point in the plane located by using an ordered
    pair of numbers, called its coordinates. Understand that the first number indicates
    how far to travel from the origin in the direction of one axis, and the second
    number indicates how far to travel in the direction of the second axis, with the
    convention that the names of the two axes and the coordinates correspond (e.g.,
    x-axis and x-coordinate, y-axis and y-coordinate).
