    Linear algebra deals with vectors, linear transformations, matrices,
    linear equations, vector spaces, projections, and many other topics.
    This is one of the most important subjects for undergraduates to learn well
    because linear algebra techniques are used all over the place.
    The computational techniques, geometric intuition, and theoretical analysis
    all combine to form a mathematical modelling toolbox that students can then
    use to tackle problems in mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering,
    computing, business, economics, and even the social sciences.
    Linear algebra is also an important stepping stone towards graduate-level
    mathematics.

     Descriptive statistics like expected values, mean, variance, covariance,
     and correlation can be used to analyze large datasets.
     But descriptive statistics is only the first step!
     By modelling the process by which the data was obtained we can infer facts
     about the underlying population, and also use the models to extrapolate
     and predict what data in the future.
     Some of the discussed include point and interval estimation, clustering,
     maximum likelihood, goodness of fit, hypothesis testing, linear regression,
     logistic regression, and others.
     Statistical methods play an important role in many applications, indeed we
     need statistics every time we're analyzing data.

  description: >
    Many problems in science and engineering are expressed as differential equations.
    A differential equation is an equation that involves an unknown function $f(t)$,
    its derivative $f'(t)$, and possibly higher derivatives like $f''(x)$.
    Using the techniques of differential equation, you can solve many types of
    differential equations and obtain the unknown function $f(t)$.
    For simple problems integration is enough but more complicated equations
    require using various solution recipes, substitutions, and other tricks.
    Differential equations are used to model physical systems to understand and
    analyze their stability and the long-term behaviour of the solutions.
    You'll also learn how to find series solutions and approximate solutions.
    Knowing how to solve differential equations is important for physicists and engineers.
